# use ?gapminder get the desciption of the dataset `gapminder`
```

Consider the dataset `gapminder`.

(a) Modify the `continent` factor by classifying the Americas' countries into `South America` and `North America`
    Hint: the following countries are in South America.
    ```r
    c("Argentina", "Bolivia", "Brazil", "Chile", "Colombia", "Ecuador", "Paraguay", "Peru", "Uruguay", "Venezuela")
    ```


In the following questions, use the dataset modified in (a).


(b) How many countries are there in the dataset? How about for each continent?



(c) Order the levels of the continent factor in alphabetical order. (Hint: do not sort the dataset)




(d) Determine the population for the continents in 2007. Re-order the continent levels again so that they appear in order of total population. (Hint: do not sort the dataset)



(e) Using the result of (d) and plot a bar chart for the population for the continents in monotonic (increasing or decreasing) order of populations.



(f) By continent, which country experienced the sharpest increment in life expectancy from 1997 to 2007?
